# IMA-3M-Final
IMA Math-to-Industry, July 2018, Final project

This repository contains the jupyter notebook I used throughout our final 6-day project at the IMA Math-to-Industry Bootcamp III at the University of Minnesota. This project, suggested by 3M, was about time series analysis of gas mixture data publicaly available here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+under+dynamic+gas+mixtures. Please see https://www.ima.umn.edu/2017-2018/SW6.18-7.27.18, Team 3, for a more detailed project description.

The repository also contains a python script with all of the custom functions written for the project. Note that these are specific to the project and do not make much sense as stand-alone functions.
